# 0x0E. SQL - More Queries

## Description

This project focuses on advanced SQL queries, specifically within the MySQL database management system. It aims to enhance your understanding and skills in managing database users, constraints, subqueries, joins, unions, and more. By the end of this project, you will be able to create and manage MySQL users, apply various SQL constraints, and perform complex queries involving multiple tables.
